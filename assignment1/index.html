     <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
     <p><span class="clickable" id="part-one">From inside the cave...</span></p>

     <p>Cavemen, or neanderthals lived in caves for homes, hunted animals for food, and made tools from stone and wood. Our ancestors from the beginning of humanity understood only what was possible from what they witnessed and experienced, until ‘The Shadow’  <span class="clickable" id="first-change">changed everything. </span>Facing the back wall of the cave, the family was amazed to see a shadow different from their own. As the sun hit the opening of the cave, a perfect circular shadow appeared with a small hole directly in the middle. The shadow moved in a stange way as it shrank and squished together deforming the shape entirely to a point that it would disappear for a split second every time it moved. The people did not understand what to make of the shadow at first, but the father pointed at the shadow and referred to it as a mighty shadow god. They got closer to try and understand what they were looking at, but <span class="clickable" id="second-change">jumped</span> as soon as the shadow got bigger in fear that the shadow god was angry. After approaching this new god, the shadow would not disappear when it got squished but the hole in the center would simply disappear. 

     <p>The concept of Flatness refers to the idea that both thought and perception are linear, and that there is only one way to understand the way that life ultimately works as a whole. The idea of flatness is a very common theme that I have experienced through the social stigma of how to progress in life. First your supposed to get an education, a job, buy a house, start a family, and than ultimately retire like everyone else does. When people do these things the way that is socially acceptable, its like they’re following steps that are socially programmed within them. People who choose to do things differently end up defining their own steps to progress in life, and are seen as strange or unflat. The way that the family interpreted the shadow was to be in disbelief because it was out of the routine of their daily lives, and outside of the singular way that they understand life. Their perception of the shadow promotes the idea that their worldview is flat, especially when they cannot comprehend that it is possible for their to be an existence of different ideas and ways of seeing things outside of what they know.

     <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>
     <p><span class="clickable" id="part-two">From outside the cave...</span></p>

     <p>Not only was the family witnessing the shadow inside the cave blown away, but the family's living in shelters outside of the cave were just as shocked. Looking at the entrance of the cave, the people outside saw a circular figure spinning in constant motion. The figure was made up of a flat yellow circle with a small hole directly in the center. Surrounding the yellow part of the figure was a thick multicolored ring that surrounded the entirety of the figure. Standing around the opening into the cave, the families outside were able to see a shadow being created by the figure, and they tried to tell the family inside about the spinning figure. The family inside told everyone outside of the cave that the figure could not be spinning; it was just squishing. Amidst the arguments between the families inside the cave and outside of the cave, the <span class="clickable" id="third-change">figure changed</span>. Outside of the cave, the families watched as the yellow part of the figure detached from the multi-colored ring that surrounded it. They yelled and told the family inside of the cave that there was a change. Outside of the cave, it was obvious that the figures were spinning, but they didn't know how to convince the family inside. Even when they tried the figures  <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">attached together again</span></span> as if the figure did not want to be seen. 
     

     <p>Seeing double is the opposite of flatness, it is the idea that there are multiple ways to perceive life as well as different ways to understand reality. To me, seeing double relates to my experience with facing social stigma when it comes to how to find a path in life. The idea behind seeing double helps me come to realize that despite the traditional pathways that are understood by society, there are so many different ways that you can progress in life. There is not one way that everyone goes through life, there is not a single flattened way to live life. The sunrise outside of the cave casts light on the mysterious figure that creates a shadow inside the cave. The people outside of the cave see the coloured figure spinning in the air outside of the cave, blocking the sunlight, whereas the people inside of the cave only see the shadow. Only being able to see the shadow, they cannot understand that something is spinning rather than a shadow simply squishing together. These two realms are connected by the idea of perception, as the people outside of the cave see both the figure and the shadow, allowing them to understand what is happening. Being outside of the cave, the people could see the 3d object rotating and causing a shadow because they had all angles of the situation. Alternatively, from inside the cave, the people could only see the shadow, resulting in a singular perception of the situation, or a flat view
